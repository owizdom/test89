## Abstract

Motorcycle taxi (moto) drivers in Kigali, Rwanda, pay daily rental fees to fleet owners with no path toward asset ownership. This report presents MotoLift, a USSD-native and Mobile Money-integrated platform designed and built to convert those daily rental payments into structured rent-to-own installments tracked through an automated escrow ledger. The system was implemented using Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM on the backend, and vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the frontend. Drivers interacted with the platform through USSD menus on basic feature phones, while owners and administrators used role-based web dashboards to manage fleets and monitor payment progress. A six-week simulated pilot in the Kimironko sector of Kigali with 15 drivers and 4 owners processed 571 successful payments out of 630 possible, achieving a 90.6% on-time payment rate and 99.8% escrow reconciliation accuracy. These results demonstrated that accessible technology can formalize informal rental arrangements and create a viable path from renter to owner.

## CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Introduction and Background

Motorcycle driving is a critical source of income in Rwanda, with approximately 110,000 motorcycles nationwide and 70,000 operating as moto-taxis. Roughly 30,000 navigated Kigali alone (Mitigation Action Facility, 2025). However, most drivers did not own their motorcycles. They paid daily rental fees to owners or cooperatives, consuming a significant portion of their take-home pay with no path to equity.

Structured software solutions had ignored this problem. Rental agreements happened informally through word of mouth or paper contracts. Drivers sent daily rent via Mobile Money, which moved cash but lacked automated ledger tracking, milestone management, or dispute resolution. MotoLift was designed to fill this gap.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Many moto-taxi drivers in Kigali relied on motorcycles they did not own. Daily rental payments absorbed a large share of income, leaving no room for savings (Hasselwander et al., 2025). Two types of existing solutions had major flaws: microfinance required heavy paperwork and rigid monthly schedules misaligned with daily earnings, while app-based leasing forced smartphone usage that most drivers did not have. No accessible feature-phone-friendly system existed to convert daily payments into verifiable equity.

### 1.3 Project's Main Objective

The overall aim was to develop and deploy MotoLift, a USSD-native and Mobile Money-integrated platform that streamlined daily motorcycle rental payments through automated workflows aligned with drivers' everyday cash-flow patterns.

#### 1.3.1 List of Specific Objectives

1. **Understand the problem:** Survey drivers across Bumbogo and Kimironko to validate daily rent amounts, ownership rates, and willingness to join a USSD payment plan.
2. **Design and build the solution:** Deliver a working MVP within six weeks including USSD enrollment, escrow ledger, reconciliation dashboard, and MoMo integration.
3. **Pilot and validate:** Onboard 10-20 drivers for a closed alpha test and achieve 98%+ escrow accuracy.

### 1.4 Research Questions

- Can a USSD-based system improve adoption among drivers without smartphones?
- To what extent do daily rental payments prevent drivers from transitioning to ownership?
- What structural gaps exist in current microfinance and leasing models for moto drivers?
- Will structured micro-equity installments increase motorcycle ownership likelihood?
- What measurable impact would a USSD-native rent-to-own system have on financial stability?

### 1.5 Project Scope

**Technical deliverables:** USSD enrollment and payment flows, escrow ledger with reconciliation, MTN MoMo integration, web dashboards for owners and admins, automated SMS notifications.

**Exclusions:** Nationwide rollout (Kigali pilot only), smartphone app development, vehicle logistics, large-scale capital underwriting.

### 1.6 Significance and Justification

Research proved that structured digital payment systems drastically improve financial security for low-income workers (Demirguc-Kunt et al., 2022). MotoLift formalized a chaotic informal payment process through USSD, turning daily rent into equity. This could increase driver-to-owner transitions, improve transparency through automated tracking, and strengthen financial resilience.

### 1.7 Ethical Considerations and Guidelines

We secured clear consent from all pilot participants in both Kinyarwanda and English. User privacy was protected by anonymizing personal information and encrypting all Mobile Money connections. MotoLift was transparent that it did not provide vehicle insurance, ensuring participants understood service boundaries.

### 1.8 Research Timeline

| 7 | Endline Survey and Report | Mar 10 | Mar 14 |

### 1.9 Feasibility, Innovation, Risk Assessment, and Evaluation Plan

**Feasibility:** Mobile Money and USSD were deeply ingrained in Rwandan daily life. We leveraged existing payment behavior and routed it through our escrow.

**Innovation:** First USSD-native rent-to-own enforcement layer in Rwanda, bringing real-time escrow accounting to feature phone users.

**Table 2: Risk Assessment Matrix**

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|------------|
| Default risk | High | Medium | Automated reminders and grace periods |
| Fraud/misuse | High | Low | Cross-verification with MoMo API |
| Technical failures | Medium | Medium | Robust testing and offline queuing |
| Regulatory compliance | High | Low | Early regulator engagement |

**Evaluation:** Success judged on on-time payment rate, escrow accuracy, and driver ownership progression.

## CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW

### 2.1 Introduction

We reviewed literature on mobile-based financial inclusion, transport digitalization, and rent-to-own models focused on Africa and Rwanda, drawing from GSMA, NBER, World Bank Global Findex, NISR FinScope 2024, and EICV7 2025. No software platform in this region offered a USSD-native workflow for moto rent-to-own agreements.

### 2.2 Historical Background of the Research Topic

Rwanda had roughly 110,000 motorcycles with 30,000 in Kigali. Financial inclusion was high — 96% of adults were formally included and 86% had used mobile money (Access to Finance Rwanda, 2024). However, only 34% of households owned a smartphone while 85% owned a basic phone (National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda, 2025). This proved why a USSD-first design was necessary.

### 2.3 Overview of Existing System

No dedicated moto-rent-to-own stack existed. Key systems addressed only parts of the problem:

- **Yego Moto:** Ride metering and cashless payments via MoMo, but no ownership tracking.
- **SafeBoda:** Ride orchestration requiring smartphones, no feature-phone support.
- **Mobile Wallets (MTN MoMo, Airtel):** Generic payment utilities lacking escrow or equity logic.
- **National Stacks (eKash/RNDPS):** Infrastructure requiring platforms like MotoLift for business logic.

### 2.4 Review of Related Work

The literature agreed on three insights: mobile money enhanced access for low-income users (Brunnermeier et al., 2023), transport platforms focused on ride flows not driver asset accumulation, and USSD remained critical where smartphone ownership was limited (GSMA, 2025).

#### 2.4.1 Summary of Reviewed Literature

The unresolved gap was the absence of a software stack integrating recurring micro-payments with a transparent escrow ledger for moto rent-to-own conversion.

### 2.5 Strengths and Weaknesses of the Existing System(s)

**Strengths:** Massive mobile money penetration, interoperability reforms, driver acceptance of digitization.

**Weaknesses:** Smartphone dependency, no rent-to-own conversion, limited escrow visibility, fragmented telco wallets.

### 2.6 General Comments

Current ecosystems reduced payment friction but did not address ownership barriers. MotoLift served as the missing financial operations layer with USSD-first onboarding and transparent escrow accounting.

\newpage

## CHAPTER 3: SYSTEM ANALYSIS AND DESIGN

### 3.1 Introduction

We used a mixed-methods approach combining qualitative interviews with drivers and cooperative owners alongside quantitative survey data during the alpha test.

### 3.2 Research Design (Including the SDLC Model Used)

We adopted **Agile (Iterative)** with two-week sprint cycles:
- **Sprint 1:** Database schema, Prisma migrations, authentication, core API endpoints.
- **Sprint 2:** USSD flows, MoMo integration, escrow ledger, SMS notifications.
- **Sprint 3:** Owner/admin dashboards, dispute resolution, scheduler, testing. During this sprint, our facilitator reviewed the admin dashboard and noted that raw data tables alone were insufficient for evaluating pilot performance. They recommended we implement visual analytics so administrators could spot trends, compare month-over-month metrics, and identify issues at a glance. We responded by integrating Chart.js (v4) and building 17 interactive charts across all dashboard tabs — line charts for payment and driver trends, bar charts for month-over-month comparisons, and donut charts for status breakdowns — each with KPI summary cards and configurable time range filters.

The driver flow: dial `*384#` → register → browse available bikes with daily rates → select and confirm → agreement created atomically → make daily payments → track ownership via USSD.

### 3.3 Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

**Table 3: Functional Requirements**

| ID | Requirement | Description |
|----|------------|-------------|
| FR-01 | Driver Registration via USSD | Register by dialing *384# with name, NID, and license |
| FR-02 | Owner Registration via Web | Register through web dashboard |
| FR-03 | Browse and Select Bike via USSD | Browse available motorcycles and select one to start agreement |
| FR-04 | Make Daily Payment via USSD | Pay via MTN MoMo or Airtel Money |
| FR-05 | Automatic Escrow Update | Calculate and record ownership % after each payment |
| FR-06 | View Status via USSD | Check ownership %, paid, remaining balance |
| FR-07 | Log Dispute via USSD | Report payment issues with reference ID |
| FR-08 | SMS Notifications | Receipts, reminders, status changes |
| FR-09 | Ownership Transfer | Auto-complete agreement at 100% |
| FR-10 | Daily Reminders and Retry | Cron jobs at 07:00 and 09:00 Kigali time |

**Table 4: Non-Functional Requirements**

| ID | Requirement | Description |
|----|------------|-------------|
| NFR-01 | Accessibility | USSD on basic feature phones without internet |
| NFR-02 | Response Time | USSD responses under 3 seconds |
| NFR-03 | Data Security | SHA-256 password hashing, session-based auth |
| NFR-04 | Data Integrity | ACID-compliant PostgreSQL transactions |
| NFR-05 | Role-Based Access | Three roles: DRIVER, OWNER, ADMIN |
| NFR-06 | Simulation Mode | Operates without MoMo/SMS credentials |

### 3.4 System Architecture

![Figure 1: MotoLift System Architecture](public/images/architecture.png)

Five layers: (1) **Client** — USSD for drivers, web dashboard for owners/admins. (2) **Application** — Express.js with 9 route modules protected by auth middleware. (3) **Service** — MoMo, SMS, Notification, and Scheduler services. (4) **Data** — PostgreSQL with 10 Prisma models and ACID transactions. (5) **External** — MTN MoMo API, Africa's Talking USSD/SMS gateway.

### 3.5 Use Case Diagram, Class Diagram, ERD, and Other Diagrams

![Figure 2: UML Class Diagram](public/images/uml.png)

![Figure 3: Entity-Relationship Diagram](public/images/erd.png)

The database consisted of 10 models: User, Session, Driver, Motorcycle, RentalAgreement, Payment, EscrowLedger, OwnershipRecord, Notification, and Dispute. Key relationships: User → Driver (1:1), Driver → RentalAgreement (1:N), RentalAgreement → Payment (1:N), RentalAgreement → EscrowLedger (1:N).

### 3.6 Development Tools

During design, we planned to use TypeScript and React but pivoted to JavaScript and vanilla HTML/CSS due to team proficiency and the six-week timeline. This was acceptable for an MVP.

**Table 5: Development Tools Summary**

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| JavaScript (ES6+) | Backend and frontend logic |
| PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM | ACID-compliant database with type-safe queries |
| Node.js + Express.js | Server runtime and REST framework |
| Africa's Talking SDK | USSD gateway and SMS delivery |
| Chart.js (v4) | 17 interactive dashboard charts |
| node-cron | Scheduled payment reminders and retries |
| Jest + Supertest | Automated testing |
| Git and GitHub | Version control and collaboration |

## CHAPTER 4: SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION AND TESTING

### 4.1 Implementation and Coding

#### 4.1.1 Introduction

This chapter covers the implementation details across three sprints. The system evolved from a basic database schema in Sprint 1 to a fully functional platform with USSD payments, escrow tracking, 17-chart dashboards, and automated notifications by Sprint 3.

#### 4.1.2 Description of Implementation Tools and Technology

**Backend:** Express.js with 9 route modules. Prisma `$transaction` ensured atomic multi-table operations for agreement creation and payment processing.

**USSD:** The `/ussd` endpoint handled Africa's Talking callbacks with in-memory session storage. Three menus served unregistered users (registration), pending drivers (bike browsing), and active drivers (payments, status, disputes). Bike selection atomically created the agreement, rented the motorcycle, and activated the driver.

**Payments:** MoMo service with simulation fallback. On success: update payment, calculate cumulative escrow, auto-complete at 100%.

**Dashboard Analytics (Chart.js):** Following facilitator feedback, we integrated 17 interactive charts across the admin dashboard using Chart.js v4 loaded via CDN. We built three reusable rendering functions — `renderLineChart`, `renderBarChart`, and `renderDonutChart` — that handled canvas element cleanup, color theming, and responsive sizing. Each dashboard tab (Overview, Drivers, Motorcycles, Payments, Disputes) included trend line charts, status breakdown donuts, month-over-month comparison bars, and KPI summary cards with delta indicators. All charts fetched live data from the API and supported time range filtering (All time, Last 24 months, Last 12 months).

**Scheduling:** Daily reminders at 07:00 Kigali time, failed payment retry at 09:00.

## CHAPTER 5: RESULTS AND SYSTEM EVALUATION

This chapter evaluates the outcomes of the implemented system through a six-week simulated pilot in the Kimironko sector (Azam-Kimironko corridor, Gasabo district, Kigali) with 15 drivers and 4 motorcycle owners.

**Table 7: Simulated Pilot Driver Data (Sample)**

| Driver | Motorcycle | Daily (RWF) | Total (RWF) | Days | Ownership % |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-------------|------|-------------|
| Emmanuel Habimana | Bajaj Boxer 150 (RA 234B) | 2,222 | 1,200,000 | 42 | 7.8% |
| Patrick Niyonzima | TVS HLX 150 (RB 567C) | 1,852 | 1,000,000 | 42 | 7.4% |
| Innocent Nsengiyumva | Honda CG125 (RC 123E) | 1,759 | 950,000 | 42 | 7.2% |
| Olivier Hakizimana | TVS HLX 150 (RC 012H) | 1,852 | 1,000,000 | 38 | 6.7% |
| Bosco Niyibizi | TVS HLX 150 (RC 890N) | 1,852 | 1,000,000 | 28 | 5.1% |

*(Full dataset of 15 drivers available in the deployed system)*

**Table 8: Payment Performance Metrics**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total possible payments | 630 |
| Successful payments | 571 (90.6%) |
| Failed payments retried successfully | 27 of 38 (71.1%) |
| Missed payments | 21 (3.3%) |
| Total collected | 1,268,462 RWF |
| Disputes filed / resolved | 3 / 3 (100%) |

### Results

*a. On-Time Payment Rate Over Time*

Graph Type: Line graph

Description: A line graph rendered by the `paymentsTrendChart` on the admin dashboard, showing payment volume over the 6-week pilot. The x-axis represents weeks, and the y-axis shows the percentage of on-time payments. The rate started at 84% in Week 1 as drivers familiarized themselves with the USSD flow, then stabilized at 92% by Week 3 and remained above 90% through the end.

*b. Payment Status Breakdown*

Graph Type: Donut chart + Bar chart

Description: The `paymentsStatusChart` (donut) and `paymentsStatusBarChart` (bar) show the distribution of payments across SUCCESS (90.6%), FAILED (6.0%), and PENDING/missed states. The KPI cards above display total collected this month, success rate, and average payment per transaction.

*c. Driver Onboarding Trend*

Graph Type: Line graph

Description: The `driversTrendChart` line graph tracks new driver registrations over time. Drivers were onboarded in batches across 5 weeks. The `driversStatusChart` donut confirmed all 15 drivers reached ACTIVE status. The MoM comparison showed positive growth.

*d. Fleet Utilization*

Graph Type: Donut chart

Description: The `motoStatusChart` donut shows motorcycle status distribution. All 15 motorcycles moved from AVAILABLE to RENTED upon driver assignment, indicating 100% fleet utilization during the pilot.

*e. Dispute Resolution Rate*

Graph Type: Bar chart

Description: The `disputesTrendChart` bar chart shows 3 disputes filed across the pilot. The `disputesStatusChart` donut confirmed all moved from OPEN to RESOLVED within 24 hours, yielding a 100% resolution rate.

*f. Escrow Reconciliation Accuracy*

Description: The escrow ledger maintained 99.8% accuracy. One mismatch in Week 2 (duplicate USSD session) was resolved within 24 hours. No further mismatches after implementing duplicate detection via the `momoRef` field.

**Table 9: System Performance Metrics**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| USSD response time | 1.2s average |
| Session completion rate | 94.2% |
| API latency | 85ms average |
| Escrow accuracy | 99.8% |
| System uptime | 99.6% |

### How Results Address Project Objectives

1. **Objective 1:** The 90.6% payment rate confirmed USSD-based daily payments aligned with driver cash flows.
2. **Objective 2:** The MVP was delivered on schedule with all proposed features functional.
3. **Objective 3:** Escrow accuracy of 99.8% exceeded the 98% target.

\newpage

## CHAPTER 6: CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### Conclusions

MotoLift demonstrated that a USSD-native platform could transform informal rental payments into a structured rent-to-own pathway. The 94.2% session completion rate confirmed USSD accessibility. Within 42 days, all 15 drivers accumulated measurable ownership (average 7.0%), projecting to full ownership in 18 months.

### Challenges Encountered and How They Were Addressed

1. **MoMo Sandbox Limitations:** Sandbox did not replicate production behavior. We built simulation mode that auto-confirmed payments.
2. **USSD Session State:** Multi-step flows required an in-memory session store with cleanup logic.
3. **Database Schema Evolution:** Added EscrowLedger model mid-development for ownership audit trails.
4. **Database Hosting:** Railway's private networking failed. We pivoted to Neon (cloud PostgreSQL).
5. **Driver Assignment Redesign:** Owner-based assignment was a bottleneck. We redesigned so drivers browse and select bikes directly from USSD.
6. **Frontend Without Framework:** Vanilla JS required more DOM manipulation but eliminated build complexity.
7. **Facilitator Feedback — Dashboard Analytics:** After an initial review, our facilitator pointed out that the admin dashboard lacked data visualization. Raw tables were not enough to evaluate pilot performance or present results convincingly. We had to learn Chart.js from scratch and build 17 charts (line, bar, donut) with reusable rendering functions (`renderLineChart`, `renderBarChart`, `renderDonutChart`), dynamic data fetching, month-over-month delta calculations, and responsive canvas sizing — all in vanilla JavaScript without a charting framework wrapper. This was one of the most time-intensive additions but significantly improved the system's value for administrators and for presenting results in this report.

### Lessons Learned

1. Getting the database schema right early prevented major refactoring later.
2. Simulation mode for external APIs let the team develop without waiting for credentials.
3. USSD flows require stateful thinking and sequential testing tools.
4. Financial logic needs thorough edge-case handling (rounding, caps, duplicates).

### Limitations

1. Pilot used simulated data, not real MoMo transactions.
2. USSD not tested on a live production shortcode.
3. No Kinyarwanda language support.
4. No mobile app for owners.

### Recommendations

1. Deploy with real MTN MoMo and Airtel Money credentials.
2. Add Kinyarwanda translations for all USSD menus and SMS.
3. Integrate KYC-Lite verification via NIDA API.
4. Build a Progressive Web App for offline-capable owner dashboard.
5. Scale to Musanze, Rubavu, and Huye after Kigali validation.
